.SH DESCRIPTION
This shell script designed for webcast. It takes an video stream from usb or ip camera and translates it on to video server for further publishing. On this way it can convert a lot of formats and codecs. It operates like a service. It restarts on any termination, caused by connection loosing or by any other failures. You can run more then one stream in the same system. Every stream can be started and stopped individually with init script, that starts all of them at boot time. It also provide versatile configuration options and logging features.
.PP
It was tested with crtmpserver, but should work with others. If the video server is running on localhost and web camera device is /dev/video0, You can start \fBflashstreamer\fP without parameters. But in general You should specify at least input stream source and destination host in configuration files. See \fBflashstreamer.conf\fP(5) for details.
