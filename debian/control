Description: Flash video webcast tool
 takes an video stream from usb or ip camera and translates it onto video
 server for further publishing. On this way it can convert a lot of formats and
 codecs. It operates like a service. It restarts on any termination, caused by
 connection loosing or by any other failures. You can run more then one stream
 in the same system.  Every stream can be started and stopped individually with
 init script, that starts all of them at boot time. It also provides versatile
 configuration options and logging features.
