Flash Streamer
--------------

This shell script designed for webcast. It takes an video stream from usb or ip
camera and translates it on to video server for further publishing. On this way
it can convert a lot of formats and codecs. It operates like a service. It
restarts on any termination, caused by connection loosing or by any other
failures. You can run more then one stream in the same system. Every stream can
be started and stopped individually with init script, that starts all of them
at boot time. It also provide versatile configuration options and logging
features.
